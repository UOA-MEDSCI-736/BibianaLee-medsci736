26th September – 2nd October (20)      
    -load data file '10D4' into python notebook (27.09.2016)

    -Determine if 10D4 and 13D4 are different (27.09.2016)
        - if they are different make a note and ask supervisor 
    -email supervisor for:(27.09.2016)
        -the remaining files 
        -ask how the output should look like
        -the aims of the project so that I can determine what to do for analysis 
        -ask about differences if there are any 
        -any other questions 
    -determine how to load multiple files on python - to be checked on Thurs
    -clean up the code after reply from supervisor <-- need to clean up labels!! 
        e.g. look at ways to minimize repeating code maybe convert to functions 
        remember to modify milestones to reflect any reply or information provided
    -start writing up methods - to be checked on Thurs
    -upload to github - email mentor about updates - 1/2 done as at 27/09/2016
    
3rd – 9th of October (20) 
    - revise code for files - atm it is not reproducible <--moved on from last week- revised after reply from supervisor and looking at rest of files ** #priority 
	- need way to extract rows without index number 
	- need way to cut out NAN values in the dataframe 
	- alternatively will look at another way to go about this e.g. loading values into the dataframe after extraction 
    -if it can handle the files slice out the means for height 0 for the left ear for a smaple of 10 files 
    - look at statistical analysis libraries - pandas or scipy 
    - Put the means through a one way ANOVA analysis using one of the libraries
        -make sure it gives out the correct output
            -maybe do this using another program? 
    - look at ways to matplot the results similar graph depicted in previous study 
    - check in with supervisor - ensure the analysis answers their aims 
    - write up final document and make sure other assignments have been completed 
        -badges 
    - Draft a readme file 
    
17th – 23rd October(15) 
    -Put rest of the means through ANOVA after slicing and merging retrieved values 
    - write up file and final assignment to reflect any changes or progress 
    - determine a new analysis that also meets the aims of the study 
    - check with supervisor about new analysis - if it gets the green light proceed 
    - look up how to do this efficiently 
    - start working on the new analysis
    - check the outputs and output formats are correct 
    - start drawing conclusions from the analysed output - the ANOVA and new analysis
    - upload to github - email mentor about updates 
    - email supervisor and ask if anything else is needed - modify accordingly 

10th – 16th October (15)
    - Ensure everything is documented 
    - Ensure everything is up to date 
    - write up and complete analysis 
    - add in anything that is remaing from previous milestones 
    - upload to github - email mentor about updates 
    - email supervisor and ask if anything else is needed 
    
24th – 30th October (10)
    - Ensure everything is documented 
    - Ensure everything is up to date 
    - write up and complete remaining analysis 
    - upload to github - email mentor about updates    
    - Finalise everything 
    - Thank everyone 
    - Hand in = done done done
